Architecture A approach: spawn subprocess, parse events, route them to app state, render live.\\n\\n**Implemented modules:**\\n- `stream.rs` — NDJSON parser with full event taxonomy (UserPromptRequest, CodeExecution, ToolUse, etc.)\\n- `claude.rs` — subprocess management (spawn, pty harness, event routing)\\n- `app.rs` — state machine (StreamState, pending request tracking, double-submit guard)\\n- `ui.rs` — Ratatui rendering (event list, live footer, status bar)\\n- `main.rs` — wiring, error handling, anyhow fallthrough\\n\\n**Test coverage:** 157 workspace tests (15 in gleisner-tui alone), all passing. PTY integration tests capture real subprocess behavior.\\n\\n### Frictions\\n\\n1. **Context compaction mid-implementation.** Compaction fired while implementing `app.rs`. Resumed from summary; rebuilding full context cost ~10 minutes. The summary was accurate (architecture decisions intact, code paths clear) but losing the problem-solving thread meant re-tracing design justifications for the double-submit guard.\\n\\n2. **Subagent sandbox failures.** Attempted to delegate web research (Ratatui patterns, Claude Agent SDK examples) to subagents via `web_search`. Both calls failed due to sandbox restrictions on subprocess spawning. Had to do the research directly — added ~15 min but yielded same results and better confidence in the sources.\\n\\n3. **Logic bug in double-submit guard.** Implemented the guard as `if !pending_request { submit }` — inverted logic. Caught during code review before integration tests; fix was one-character change. This is the satisfying kind of friction: found before reaching production.\\n\\n### Sparks\\n\\n1. **Stream parser came together cleanly.** Captured real wire data from 5 live Claude Code sessions, wrote serde types covering 8 event variants, 7 unit tests all passed on first run. The NDJSON structure mapped directly — no surprises in the JSON shape or field naming. Feels like the right level of abstraction: events are first-class, not just parsed strings.\\n\\n2. **PTY harness is genuinely useful.** E...\"}}\n","stdout":"{\"hookSpecificOutput\":{\"hookEventName\":\"SessionStart\",\"additionalContext\":\"You are in 'explanatory' output style mode, where you should provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with the user's task.\\n\\nYou should be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task.
