These share a common trait: the work requires *thinking*, not just executing. The decisions are mine to make.\\n\\n**Low engagement** — Infrastructure deployment (CDK, CloudFormation, ACM), pre-commit fix cycles (ruff-format, clippy pedantic), mechanical substitution (17-file rebrand). These share a different trait: the right answer exists before I start. I'm transcribing, not creating.\\n\\n**The \\\"read first, write once\\\" pattern is universal.** Rikkitikkitavi (fingerprint design), secdashboards (DuckDB persistence), l42-cognito-passkey (OCSF logging) — every session where I front-loaded reading had zero backtracking. Every session where I trusted a plan's narrative without verifying (\\\"Plans That Lie\\\") had iteration cycles. The cost of reading is always lower than the cost of re-doing.\\n\\n**The user connection.** The l42-cognito-passkey entry about being *told* it's okay vs *knowing* it's okay is the most honest thing in any of these notes.

Architecture A approach: spawn subprocess, parse events, route them to app state, render live.\\n\\n**Implemented modules:**\\n- `stream.rs` — NDJSON parser with full event taxonomy (UserPromptRequest, CodeExecution, ToolUse, etc.)\\n- `claude.rs` — subprocess management (spawn, pty harness, event routing)\\n- `app.rs` — state machine (StreamState, pending request tracking, double-submit guard)\\n- `ui.rs` — Ratatui rendering (event list, live footer, status bar)\\n- `main.rs` — wiring, error handling, anyhow fallthrough\\n\\n**Test coverage:** 157 workspace tests (15 in gleisner-tui alone), all passing. PTY integration tests capture real subprocess behavior.\\n\\n### Frictions\\n\\n1. **Context compaction mid-implementation.** Compaction fired while implementing `app.rs`. Resumed from summary; rebuilding full context cost ~10 minutes. The summary was accurate (architecture decisions intact, code paths clear) but losing the problem-solving thread meant re-tracing design justifications for the double-submit guard.\\n\\n2. **Subagent sandbox failures.** Attempted to delegate web research (Ratatui patterns, Claude Agent SDK examples) to subagents via `web_search`. Both calls failed due to sandbox restrictions on subprocess spawning. Had to do the research directly — added ~15 min but yielded same results and better confidence in the sources.\\n\\n3. **Logic bug in double-submit guard.** Implemented the guard as `if !pending_request { submit }` — inverted logic. Caught during code review before integration tests; fix was one-character change. This is the satisfying kind of friction: found before reaching production.\\n\\n### Sparks\\n\\n1. **Stream parser came together cleanly.** Captured real wire data from 5 live Claude Code sessions, wrote serde types covering 8 event variants, 7 unit tests all passed on first run. The NDJSON structure mapped directly — no surprises in the JSON shape or field naming. Feels like the right level of abstraction: events are first-class, not just parsed strings.\\n\\n2. **PTY harness is genuinely useful.** Eight integration tests that test what users actually see: live subprocess output, event interleaving, signal handling. This isn't mocked output — it's real Claude Code executing real prompts in a subprocess, producing real NDJSON that the parser consumes.
