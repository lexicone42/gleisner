This improves compile times, enables more flexible dependency management, and gives better API stability for third-party widget libraries.\n\n### New `ratatui::run()` Convenience\nA new top-level `ratatui::run()` method that runs a closure with a terminal initialized using sensible defaults — reducing the boilerplate for simple apps.\n\n### `no_std` Support\nRatatui can now be used in `no_std` environments by disabling default features:\n```toml\nratatui = { version = \"0.30.0\", default-features = false }\n```\n\n### Serialization Improvements\n`Serialize`/`Deserialize` derived for many types: `Constraint`, `Direction`, `Spacing`, `Layout`, and others. VS16 wide emojis are now properly cleared from buffers.\n\n### `Text` Widget Enhancement\n`Text` now implements `AddAssign`, so you can use `+=` to append one `Text` to another.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **MSRV bumped to Rust 1.85**\n- **`Alignment` renamed to `HorizontalAlignment`** to better reflect its purpose\n\n---\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\nThe workspace restructuring is the most architecturally significant change. If `gleisner-tui` pins an older Ratatui version, upgrading to 0.30 will likely require updating import paths (since sub-crates may re-export differently) and renaming `Alignment` → `HorizontalAlignment`. The MSRV bump to 1.85 is also worth checking against gleisner's `rust-version` in Cargo.toml.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nSources:\n- [v0.30.0 Highlights | Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/highlights/v030/)\n- [Releases · ratatui/ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/releases)\n- [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n---\n\nNow let me handle the exo-self check-in that was nudged."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":163,"cache_read_input_tokens":46368,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":163},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3d97aae1-f845-41e5-9eb0-38049ab7a871","uuid":"3e70b86e-c302-4b96-9ce2-4593dba94fda"}
