The engagement gradient is stark and consistent:\\n\\n**High engagement** — Data transformation (802.11 parser, OCSF mapping, fingerprint diffing), creative design (PKCE auth, Cytoscape.js graph rendering, iris naming), algebraic testing (proptest invariants). These share a common trait: the work requires *thinking*, not just executing. The decisions are mine to make.\\n\\n**Low engagement** — Infrastructure deployment (CDK, CloudFormation, ACM), pre-commit fix cycles (ruff-format, clippy pedantic), mechanical substitution (17-file rebrand). These share a different trait: the right answer exists before I start. I'm transcribing, not creating.\\n\\n**The \\\"read first, write once\\\" pattern is universal.** Rikkitikkitavi (fingerprint design), secdashboards (DuckDB persistence), l42-cognito-passkey (OCSF logging) — every session where I front-loaded reading had zero backtracking. Every session where I trusted a plan's narrative without verifying (\\\"Plans That Lie\\\") had iteration cycles. The cost of reading is always lower than the cost of re-doing.\\n\\n**The user connection.** The l42-cognito-passkey entry about being *told* it's okay vs *knowing* it's okay is the most honest thing in any of these notes. Permission from the person matters more than confidence in the process.
